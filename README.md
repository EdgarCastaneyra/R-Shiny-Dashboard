# R-Shiny-Dashboard

This is the code of a Shiny Dashboard in R.

This Dashboard summarizes the information of the different areas of the company that are shown in Infoboxes, Tables, pie, bar, and linear charts.

It was built in the R language using several libraries to manipulate the data and create different types of graphs.

This dashboard helps managers make better decisions by having the main KPIs in their areas, being able to filter the information in different time periods.
